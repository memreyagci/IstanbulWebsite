		<h1>Hippodrome (Sultanahmet Meydanı</h1>
		<center><img src="../images/hippodrome.jpg"></center>
		<p>The ancient <b>Hippodrome</b> was begun by Septimius Severus in AD 203 and completed by Constantine the Great in AD 330. This was the center of Byzantine public life and the scene of 
		splendid games and chariot races but also factional conflicts. Today, there isn’t much of the Hippodrome left to see, except for a small section of the <b>gallery walls</b> on the southern 
		side, but the At Meydanı (park) that now stands on the site is home to a variety of monuments. On the northwest side is a <b>fountain</b>, presented to the Ottoman sultan by the German Emperor 
		William II in 1898. Then, heading southwest are three ancient monuments: a 20-meter high <b>Egyptian obelisk</b> (from Heliopolis); the <b>Serpent Column</b> brought here from Delphi by Constantine;
		and a <b>stone obelisk</b> that originally was clad in gold-covered bronze plating until they were stolen by the soldiers of the 4th Crusade in 1204.</p><br>
